# Foundations of Problem-Solving and Programming

Ahoj, welcome to the first lection.

**What I'll Share With You:** You don't need any prior programming know-how to start this adventure. Just bring your curiosity and love for puzzles. I'll guide you through the basics of how computers process information and how we communicate with them. Think of it as learning a new language, but instead of speaking to people, you're chatting with computers!

**What You'll Discover:** By the end of this lection, you'll have a new perspective on solving problems and understand the foundational steps of talking to machines. It's an exciting first step into the world of programming.

*Note:* No worries I will go slowly on you I will provide as much assistance and help as I can to make it pleasant experience for both of us. So let's start.
